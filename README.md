# Map
The provided HTML and JavaScript code is designed to display a map using Mapbox and animate a marker moving between predefined bus stops. Here's a description of the code and how to run it, as well as suggestions for future enhancements:

### Code Description:

1. **HTML Structure:**
   - The HTML structure defines a basic webpage with a map container (`<div id="map">`) and a button to trigger the animation.

2. **CSS Styles:**
   - The CSS styles define the layout and positioning of the map and overlay elements.

3. **JavaScript Logic:**
   - Initializes the Mapbox map instance and adds a marker at the initial bus stop.
   - The `move()` function is responsible for animating the marker's movement between bus stops.

### How to Run the Code:
To run this code, follow these steps:

1. Save the provided HTML code into a file, for example, `map_animation.html`.
2. Open the file in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

When you click the "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" button, the marker will move sequentially between the bus stops.

### Future Enhancements:
Here are some suggestions for enhancing this map animation:

1. **Customized Marker Icon:**
   - Use a custom marker icon to make the map visualization more appealing.

2. **Path Animation:**
   - Display a line or path connecting the bus stops to visualize the route.

3. **Speed Control:**
   - Allow the user to control the speed of the animation.

4. **User Interaction:**
   - Enable user interaction to choose the starting and ending points for the animation.

5. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the map and animation are responsive for different screen sizes and devices.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling for cases like incorrect Mapbox access token or loading issues.

7. **Additional Information:**
   - Display additional information about each bus stop (e.g., name, time, etc.) as the marker moves.

These enhancements would improve the user experience and provide additional functionality and visual appeal to the map animation.
